# AES <br />
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Implementation in C <br />
Simple Example of AES using Mcrypt API. <br />
The Mcrypt API can download from [here](http://mcrypt.hellug.gr/) <br />
The **aes_test.c** file is the example from the API website to verify the Implementation work sucessfully. <br />
The **aes.c** file is the example to encrypt a messsge of size 128 bits or less (16 characters). <br />
More Example will come later <br />

**Unix compilation: gcc c_file_name -lmcrypt -lltdl -o output_file_name <br />
Usage: ./output_file_name** <br />
